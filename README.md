# Form Builder
This project is split into two repositories. The front-end, built using React and Next.js, is in this repository. The back-end, built using Ruby on Rails, can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/nikodittmar/form-builder-backend). 

## Features
- Create, save, and edit forms.
- Easy to use and intuituve UI.
- Many component options including:
  - Text Field
  - Text Area
  - Number Picker
  - Check Boxes
  - Radio Buttons
  - Date Picker
  - Time Picker
  - File Upload
  - Address Field
- Easily edit component labels, placeholders, and helpers.
- Drag and drop for ordering components and check box/radio button options.

## How it Works
The form builder creates a JSON array containing all of the components used in the form. This JSON schema can be interpreted to create a form. Because the front-end and the back-end are seperate (The back-end is a seperate rails api), this form builder can easily be consumed by other applications such as a mobile form building app.
